title: The Structured Abstain Problem and the Lovász Hinge
abstract: The Lovász hinge is a convex surrogate recently proposed for structured
  binary classification, in which k binary predictions are made simultaneously and
  the error is judged by a submodular set function. Despite its wide usage in image
  segmentation and related problems, its consistency has remained open. We resolve
  this open question, showing that the Lovász hinge is inconsistent for its desired
  target unless the set function is modular. Leveraging a recent embedding framework,
  we instead derive the target loss for which the Lovász hinge is consistent. This
  target, which we call the structured abstain problem, allows one to abstain on any
  subset of the k predictions. We derive two link functions, each of which are consistent
  for all submodular set functions simultaneously.
